Myrans is a local restaurant in Arnaudville, LA. I built this website as a personal project for the restaurant, providing a complete online presence including menu pages, contact information, and basic site analytics. The website was offered free of charge to the owners, but it was never used as I did not receive a response from them.

This project was built using Next.js, TypeScript, and CSS, and hosted on Firebase. I also connected the site to Google Analytics to track user activity and engagement. This project served as an opportunity to practice building a production-ready website with responsive design, clean code structure, modern frontend technologies, and basic analytics integration.
